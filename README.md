This is a personal for-fun project for me to learn some data-specific Python modules.
It's based off of a real problem my friend had to solve at work, but all the data is randomly generated and has no relation to the original problem.
Running main.py will generate any number of work items, then it will categorize, sort, and count them all, before finally producing a PowerBI-friendly CSV to visualize the data.
